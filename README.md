## Workspace Page
- Within each workspace, users can create multiple files. Each file features a text editor with capabilities for text formatting, tables, ordered and unordered lists, and image insertion.

- AI Integration: The text editor integrates with the Google Gemini AI model, allowing users to utilize AI for tasks like generating project progress tracking tables. Users can prompt the AI to create content based on their needs.
e.g) Create a Project progresss tracking table and here is the result

## Problem statement


- Ineffective Collaboration: Teams struggle with tools that do not support real-time updates or easy sharing of workspaces, leading to miscommunication and inefficiencies.

- Limited Functionality in Text Editing: Conventional text editors lack advanced features like AI-powered assistance for creating and managing content, which can slow down project progress.

- Difficulty in Managing Workspaces: Users need a streamlined way to organize and access multiple workspaces and files, which is often cumbersome in traditional systems.

- Enhance teams Productivity

- Lack of Integrated Communication: Teams require integrated communication tools to facilitate discussions and ensure everyone is on the same page.
